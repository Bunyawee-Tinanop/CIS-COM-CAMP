# CIS COM CAMP - Python for Beginners 🐍

## 📌 Project Overview

This project showcases my role as an **instructor and content developer** for a Python programming workshop aimed at high school students. It was part of **CIS COM CAMP**, an outreach program organized by computer science students to teach basic coding skills in local schools.

I designed and taught beginner-friendly content in Python, focusing on fundamental concepts such as data types, control structures, and functions — all delivered through Jupyter Notebooks with hands-on exercises.
